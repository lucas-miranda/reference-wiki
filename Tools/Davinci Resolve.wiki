== Using MP4 As Input ==

    First it will need to be converted to an intermediate format to davinci resolve (at free version) be able to read it:

{{{
    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 \
        -c:v dnxhd -profile:v dnxhr_hq -pix_fmt yuv422p \
        -c:a pcm_s16le \
        -f mov output.mov
}}}

    File output will be really big, so there is a alternative, but with loss of quality:

{{{
    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 \
        -c:v mpeg4 -qscale:v 1 \
        -c:a pcm_s16le \
        -f mov output.mov
}}}
