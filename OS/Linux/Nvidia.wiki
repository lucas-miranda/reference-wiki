* Modules
    Don't forget to include modules: `nvidia`, `nvidia_modeset`, `nvidia_uvm` and `nvidia_drm`, to the initramfs¹, this step is very important to completely avoid `mesa` being loaded, as OpenGL driver, by the system before `nvidia` could.

    To ensure `nvidia` is being used as OpenGL driver, instead `mesa`, check it through:

        *λ* glxinfo | grep OpenGL

    It should *not* mention `mesa`, or something like `llvmpipe`, anywhere, but instead should display something like `NVIDIA` along with your card name and infos.

-------------

1. initramfs configuration file is located at `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`
