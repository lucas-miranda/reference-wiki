== Must Have Packages ==

    * {{https://github.com/Jguer/yay|yay}}
        Arch package helper.
        Because sometimes pacman isn't enough.

== Packages ==

=== Pacman ===

* Packages from official repositories can be installed using:
    # pacman -S package-name

* Upgrading packages:
    # pacman -Syu

* When installing packages from {{aur.archlinux.org}}:
    1. git clone url
    2. cd package-folder/
    3. makepkg -si
        * *-s* / *--syncdeps*: Installs missing dependencies through pacman
        * *-i* / *--install*: Installs package after succesfully generating it

=== Yay ===

* Clear unused dependencies:
    # yay -Yc

* Clear cache:
    # yay -Scc
