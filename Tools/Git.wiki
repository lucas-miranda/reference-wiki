== Tips ==

* `restore`
    1. If you use `restore` regularly, don't *ever ever* use it without thinking about changes you are discarding. Always be sure of what you are doing, because there is *no* way to undo a restore action through git.

== Quick Actions ==

* Pull without overwriting local files
    *!* `Use with caution`

    *Î»* git pull `[remote]` `[branch]` --allow-unrelated-histories

    Normally I use this before sending my first commit to a repository, to sync local one with the upstream.
    Alternatively, stash can be used instead of this (and is a safer way, if you don't know what you are doing).
